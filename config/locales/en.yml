        The major language I use is Objective-C and Ruby. Mostly work with Cocoa/iOS SDK and Rails Framework. Love to work with Designers and Creative people. Started to learn C language from college since I was Electrical Engineer major. Got interested in software development. Took some JAVA classes and teach myself Obj-C on Senior year.
        Moved to New york to work with more Desinged centric people.
